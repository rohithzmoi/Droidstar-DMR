# Modified DROIDSTAR DMR App for iOS & Android

This project is a modified version of the [original Droidstar App](https://github.com/nostar/DroidStar) by Doug McLain. The modifications introduce new features and enhancements to improve user experience and functionality.

This project uses QT 6.7.2

## New Features

I am excited to announce the release of several new features and improvements:

- **Automatic Operator Information Display**: The app now automatically fetches the operator's first name (referred to as the "Handle") based on their DMR ID and displays it below the "Call Sign." The operator's "Country" is also displayed next to the "Handle."

- **New QSO Tab**: A new QSO Tab has been introduced, which logs the 250 most recent calls (Last Heard). This tab displays the Call Sign, DMR ID, TGID, Handle, Country, and logged time in local time. The logs are now persistently stored, remaining intact even after restarting the app.

- **TX Button and Net Status Integration**: The QSO Tab now includes a TX button with integrated Net Status, providing real-time feedback on the connection status (Host Connected or Not Connected).

- **Enhanced Export Options**: You can now export QSO logs in CSV or ADIF formats. Additionally, you can selectively choose specific log entries for inclusion in the exported file.

- **"Last Heard" on Home Page**: The app now features "Last Heard" as two rows on the home page, providing quick access to recent transmissions. The AMBES notification has been moved to the Settings for better organization.

- **Quick Access Buttons**: Added a button in the QSO entries that opens a menu to visit the station's QRZ, BM, and APRS pages directly from the app.

- **Background Functionality for Android & iOS Users**: The app now supports background operation for Android & iOS users, allowing it to continue running while switching between applications. This feature is particularly useful for tasks like checking a station's QRZ page while maintaining uninterrupted RX. iOS users will now be able to connect to Bluetooth devices as well.

- **Simplified User Interface**: The user interface has been simplified by replacing the text "Main" with a "Home" icon for a more intuitive experience.
